# Electronic_Sales_Data_Analysis
In this project I have answered 5 questions from the stakeholders who own an Electronics Retail Store.
Most of the code written in the file is simple, but it solves complex real world business problems.
The most challenging part that I faced in the project was to combine 12 csv files into a single dataframe.
